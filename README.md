**Project 1:** College Career Advisor (Taught GUI creation in C++ and Backward/Forward chaining principles)

**Summary:** A group project of three members. Inside folder has Report detailing the project, as well as an executable that 
will run on windows. The program implements forward and backward chaining inside a Windows GUI program. The user navigates a series of questions to arrive at a conclusion of career path. In order to properly run the code, link wxWidgets library to project. ***MORE IN REPORT INSIDE FOLDER***

**Project 2:** A star algorithm and the 8 tile puzzle (Taught A star and heurstic functions)

**Summary:** A group project of three members. Inside folder has Report detailing the project, First created the node structure that
swaps the blank tile with other tiles through.
a linked list. Starts with two different initial states, and runs Astar to  reach the goal state through five different heuristic 
functions. Then outputs execution time (ET), the number of nodes generated (NG), the number of nodes expanded (NE), depth of the 
tree (d), effective branching factor b* (NG/d), and the memory used (MO) for each initial state and each heuristic function.
