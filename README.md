**Project 1:** Backward and Forward Chaining

**Summary:** A group project of three members. 

**Project 2:** A star algorithm and the 8 tile puzzle

**Summary:** A group project of three members. First created the node structure that swaps the blank tile with other tiles through
a linked list. Starts with two different initial states, and runs Astar to  reach the goal state through five different heuristic 
functions. Then outputs execution time (ET), the number of nodes generated (NG), the number of nodes expanded (NE), depth of the 
tree (d), effective branching factor b* (NG/d), and the memory used (MO) for each initial state and each heuristic function.
